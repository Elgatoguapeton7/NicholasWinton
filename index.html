      <td colspan="4" align="center"><p data-start="188" data-end="482">Nicholas Winton was a British humanitarian best known for organizing the rescue of <strong data-start="271" data-end="301">669 mostly Jewish children</strong> from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in 1939. His effort became known as part of the <strong data-start="384" data-end="403">Kindertransport</strong>. He arranged trains, visas, and foster families in the UK—largely in secret.</p>
        <p data-start="484" data-end="728">His actions didn&rsquo;t become widely known until the late 1980s, when his wife discovered documents detailing the rescue. A famous 1988 BBC program revealed his story publicly, bringing many of the survivors (&ldquo;Winton&rsquo;s children&rdquo;) together with him.</p>
        <p data-start="730" data-end="831">Winton was later knighted and became a symbol of courage and moral responsibility in times of crisis.</p>
        <p data-start="730" data-end="831">In late 1938, Winton visited Prague at the request of a friend working with refugees. He saw thousands of families fleeing Hitler&rsquo;s expanding control and realized that many children were in immediate danger.Winton was invited to a BBC program, <strong data-start="1566" data-end="1584">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Life!&rdquo;</strong>, unaware that the audience included many of the people he had rescued as children.</p>
        <p data-start="2461" data-end="2605">Winton died in 2015 at the age of <strong data-start="2495" data-end="2502">106</strong>.<br data-start="2503" data-end="2506">
          Today, he is remembered as a symbol of moral courage—someone who took action when others hesitated.</p>
      <p data-start="2607" data-end="2699">The people he saved have gone on to form a vast &ldquo;Winton family&rdquo; of thousands of descendants.</p></td>
